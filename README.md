#Once upon a time#

Once upon a time, a long long time ago actually, in a far far away galaxy whose name cannot be spoken, lived a gargantuan monster whose name also could not be spoken ...
Yeah I know that won't be easy for narration, so let's forget about that rule.
His name was Be'lakhor, also known as the Dark Master, the Devourer of Souls, the Master of Infinite Pain, and a myriad of other names and titles but let's just call him Be'la.

Be'la was afraid to lose the intergalactic war because the Space Goblins have a massive destruction weapon to annihilate absolutly everthing ! The last planet where he lived was destruct by them. 
And Be'la in his quality of gargantuan monster knew he stood very little chance against the miryad of his ennemies.
